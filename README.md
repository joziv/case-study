# case-study

% clicks per partner per day - use booking, expedia, Hotels.com, Agoda as main and all other as other partners
- create a workflow that would store data on clickouts in a table partitioned by ymd
- schedule this for 10 am everyday
- Also, make this table available in Impala
- And lastly create a kpi controller showing the results in kpi controller with partners as breakouts(% of share for each partner)
